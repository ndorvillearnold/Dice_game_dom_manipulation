Strategy:

1. Create a function to randomize numbers
2. get both players dice by document by ID
3. display who wins




Improve code.
LATER: Ensure players cant go more then 1 time. It has to be player 1 then 2 each 
event listener
if statement to loop through if player one or two


Simply click on refresh on the browser to see dice change ! I will enhance code when I can
