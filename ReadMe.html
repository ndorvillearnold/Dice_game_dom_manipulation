# Dice Game for Family ðŸ˜Š

This is a fun dice game I created for my family. The game randomly generates dice rolls for two players, then displays the winner based on which player rolled the higher number. It's a simple yet engaging game, and the loser will do the dishes! The game uses DOM manipulation and randomization to update dice rolls each time the page is refreshed.
since my kids always fight about who is washing the dishes they can just role the dice ðŸ˜Š

## Introduction

The game allows two players to take turns rolling a dice, and the player with the higher roll wins. The winner is displayed on the screen along with the dice rolls. This is a fun way for my kids to learn about randomness and fairness in a simple way. The main goal is to ensure that only one player rolls at a time.

## How it Works

1. **Randomizing Numbers**: A function is created to generate random numbers for the dice rolls.
2. **Displaying Dice Rolls**: Both players' dice rolls are displayed using the `document.getElementById()` method.
3. **Determine Winner**: The game compares the dice rolls and displays who wins.

## Game Flow

1. Player 1 rolls the dice, generating a random number between 1 and 6.
2. Player 2 rolls their dice.
3. The game compares the dice rolls.
4. The player with the higher roll is declared the winner, and the other player will do the dishes!

## What I Learned

- **DOM Manipulation**: I learned how to use `document.getElementById()` to grab elements from the HTML and update their content dynamically. This is crucial for displaying the dice rolls and the winner.
- **Console Logging**: While building the game, I used `console.log()` to check the values of variables (like the dice rolls) and to troubleshoot what was happening in the code. This helped me understand the flow of data and see the changes in real-time.
- **JavaScript Functions**: I also learned how to use functions to group related tasks like randomizing the dice numbers and comparing the results. Functions helped keep my code clean and reusable.

## Code Improvements (Future Work)

- **Ensure Players Take Turns**: Add logic to ensure that player 1 goes first, followed by player 2. I plan to use event listeners and a loop to enforce this turn-taking order.
- **Event Listeners**: I will implement event listeners to ensure that players cannot roll more than once per turn and can only roll when it's their turn.
- **Enhancements**: In the future, I will improve the game's UI, add animations, and perhaps introduce more features like score tracking.
