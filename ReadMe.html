Strategy:

1. Create a function to randomize numbers
2. Create an onclick for each player 
2. Create a function to put each image to its corresponding image so when its clicked it shows the number

with refresh button can I have the verbiage be clicked to refresh the screen?

Player 1 & 2 should be buttons

I have the six images of the dice. When the screan is refreshed I need it to randomize dice selection

push it into HTML? to show as innher HTML?

if statement to loop through if player one or two

do one player at a time to make sure that works before workong on player 2.

create Javascript file to add all the functions, methods, etc

I need push buttons to play


Improve code.
LATER: Ensure players cant go more then 1 time. It has to be player 1 then 2 each <time datetime=""></time>
